                    <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">It has been rightly said that while knowledge without application is simply knowledge, applying that knowledge in our daily lives is wisdom and this is the driving force behind the  Investigative Sciences module. Last month, we learnt about the steps of the Scientific  Method, identifying different variables in our experiments and the process of writing a Lab  Report. And in the last two weeks, we have been applying that knowledge via a series  of entertaining experiments, ranging from <strong> shadow puppets</strong> to<strong>exploding watermelons</strong>. </p>
    
                
                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Our first experiment was simulation based, where we picked topics that pique our individual  interests and conducted our own experiments based on them.  </p>

                </p>

            </div>
            <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">We also conducted an experiment on 'Shadow Puppets' and for this, we worked in  smaller groups, making our own puppets out of paper and determining our own research  questions. </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/CL.png" style="width: 100%" alt="">

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p class="sub-title pad-bt15">Finally, we had the most exciting experiment of the term - exploding watermelons. The idea  behind this experiment was to find out how many rubber-bands were needed to be put around a  watermelon for it to explode. A few unfortunate students were on the receiving end of the  watermelon's fury but most of us escaped unscathed. 
                    The Investigative Science module is one of the most enjoyable modules because we learn by  applying our knowledge through a variety of experiments. If you hear the buzz of excited students coming from an IB lab, you are likely to have stumbled into another one of our ongoing Investigative Sciences classes, where we have been working on an experiment to apply what we had learnt. </p>
